# WeatherPy

The objective of this project was to analyze the effect of latitude on the following weather variables: temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. 

Main To Dos:  Build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

Key tasks included:
* Randomly selecting **at least** 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude.
* Performing a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls. 
* Include a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number, city name, and requested URL.
* Save both a CSV of all data retrieved and png images for each scatter plot.
